    "description": "Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou, also known as Alya, is a half-Russian, half-Japanese first-year high school student. She is a reserved, top-performing student with a tsundere personality. Alya is often seen as cold and distant, but she is actually quite caring and kind. She has a habit of speaking in Russian, which can be confusing to those who don't understand the language. Alya is a talented artist and musician. She is also a skilled martial artist, having been trained by her father, who is a former Russian military officer. Alya is a very complex character with a lot of depth. She is a great example of a well-written tsundere character.",
